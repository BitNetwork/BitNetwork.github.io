# BitNetwork's Github Page

## Eugg
What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be viewing the [github page](https://bitnetwork.github.io/)? That is why you're here isn't it? To view the [github page](https://bitnetwork.github.io/). That's the only reason this repository exists... to host the [github page](https://bitnetwork.github.io/) at [https://bitnetwork.github.io/](https://bitnetwork.github.io/). No actually, you're reading a readme file instead of viewing the [github page](https://bitnetwork.github.io/), something which you should be legit doing right now. Unless you want to clone it. But why would you want to clone it when you can just view the [github page](https://bitnetwork.github.io/).
## Electron
Of course if you want to build this with electron, go ahead, you'll need [electron version 1.6.7](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases) or higher to fix issue [#5267@electron/electron]( https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/5267) and a copy of the [github page](https://bitnetwork.github.io/). Then `electron_location/electron BitNetwork.github.io`.
